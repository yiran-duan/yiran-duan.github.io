This is a masterâ€™s and PhD level class that teaches students how to do data analysis and visualization using R. Each week, I create presentations and guide students through over 100 lines of R code in real-time. I start with an overview of the key concepts, then type a block of code while students follow along. Then I ask questions/explain the code. I also walk around the computer lab to make sure everyone is on the same page.
