Taught about 25 undergraduates per semester for Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 in thinking about the relations between data and society. Covered topics such as artificial intelligence (AI), power of social media, and data justice. 19 out of 20 students who completed the Spring 2023 course evaluation chose “agree” or “strongly agree” that I was highly effective in teaching this class.
