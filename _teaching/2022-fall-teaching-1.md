**IST 343 Data in Society**

_Undergraduate course. Fall 2022, Spring 2023_

Taught about 25 undergraduates per semester for Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 in thinking about the relations between data and society. Covered topics such as artificial intelligence (AI), power of social media, and data justice. 19 out of 20 students who completed the Spring 2023 course evaluation chose “agree” or “strongly agree” that I was highly effective in teaching this class.

_Graduate course. Fall 2024_

A master's and PhD level class that I teach on how to do data analysis and visualization using R. Each week, I create presentations and guide students through over 100 lines of R code in real-time for them to follow along.
