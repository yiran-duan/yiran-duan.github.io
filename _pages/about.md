Greetings! I'm a PhD student at the Syracuse University iSchool. My research interest is in online opinion leaderships, espeically in the context of social movements and climate change debates. I'm lucky enough to be advised by [Dr.Jeff Hemsley](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeff-hemsley/). I use both qualitative (interview) and quantitative (machine learning, statistical analysis) methods to conduct my research. 

## Research

1. Qualitative Research: how some users of [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com) think their practices on this platform change the design industry and design education. Read about it [here](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pra2.604).
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

## Life

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
