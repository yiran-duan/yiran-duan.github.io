# Home

Greetings! I'm a PhD candidate at the [Syracuse University iSchool](https://ischool.syr.edu). My research interest is in online opinion leaderships, espeically in the context of social movements and climate change debates. I'm very lucky to be advised by [Dr.Jeff Hemsley](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeff-hemsley/). I use both qualitative (interview) and quantitative (machine learning, statistical analysis) methods to conduct my research. I've also been learning Python to gain a better understanding of my tweet collections.

## Research

1. Qualitative Research: how some users of [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com) think their practices on this platform impact the design industry and design education. Method: semi-structured interview & Fisher's test. Read our work [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeff-Hemsley/publication/364431394_Disrupting_Design_A_Multi-level_Technological_Transition_Study_of_Dribbblecom/links/635173218d4484154a1bd901/Disrupting-Design-A-Multi-level-Technological-Transition-Study-of-Dribbblecom.pdf). ![This is an image](https://yiran-duan.github.io/images/dribbble.jpg)
(Yes, I blurred th 30 participants' faces in this picture to protect their privacy :] It only shows the other reseracher's and mine.)

2. Quantitative Research: what kinds of information got spreaded the most about Derek Chauvin's trial containing the hashtags of #BlackLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter. Method: Text annotation & machine learning.
