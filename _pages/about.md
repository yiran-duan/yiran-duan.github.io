# Home

**I am on the 2024 -2025 job market!** 

Greetings! I'm a PhD candidate (ABD) in the [School of Information Studies at Syracuse University (the iSchool)](https://ischool.syr.edu). My research explores information flows and the key actors involved, particularly across different social media platforms. My reserach topics are social and enviromental justice, such as #Black/Blue/AllLivesMatter and climate change. I'm advised by [Dr.Jeff Hemsley](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeff-hemsley/). I use both qualitative (semi-structured interview) and quantitative (machine learning models, statistical analysis, and data visualization) methods to conduct my research.

## Research

1. Qualitative Research: An interview study that explores how [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com) influences, and influenced by its users' practice and the design industry. Method: semi-structured interview & Fisher's test. Read our work that published in _Social Media + Society_ [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20563051241228601). ![This is an image](https://yiran-duan.github.io/images/dribbble.jpg)
(Yes, I blurred th 30 participants' faces in this picture to protect their privacy :] It only shows the other interviewer's and mine.)

2. Quantitative Research: A study that investigates what kinds of information about #Black/Blue/AllLivesMatter got posted and spread during the Black History month of 2022. Methods: content analysis, machine learning models, and data visualization. Read our work that published in _Social Media + Society_ [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20563051241242799).![This is an image](https://yiran-duan.github.io/images/BLM-SMS-journal-pic.png)

3. Cross-platform Research: A study that explores the content of 80 Instagram Reels, TikTok videos, YouTube Shorts, and YouTube regular videos and thier 69,000+ comments about climate change using content analysis, regresions, and social network analysis. I am going to present this study at the _Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T)_ conference in Calgary, Canada, in October 2024.

## Teaching

1. IST 343 Data in Society (the recitation section) for Fall 2022 and Spring 2023. Proud to report that 95% of the Spring 2023 course evaluation rated my teaching as highly effective.

2. IST 719 Data Visualization for Fall 2024. It's a master's and PhD level class that teaches students how to use R for data analysis and visualization. Each week, I create presentations and guide students through over 100 lines of R code in real-time. I start with an overview of the key concepts, then type a block of code while students follow along. Then I ask questions/explain the code. I also walk around the computer lab to make sure everyone is on the same page.  

## Life

When I'm not working on my research projects, I like to swim and play with my dog Mia.
