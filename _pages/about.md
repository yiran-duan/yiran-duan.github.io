# Home

Greetings! I'm a PhD candidate at the [Syracuse University iSchool](https://ischool.syr.edu). My research interest is in online opinion leaderships, espeically in the context of social movements and climate change debates. I'm lucky enough to be advised by [Dr.Jeff Hemsley](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeff-hemsley/). I use both qualitative (interview) and quantitative (machine learning, statistical analysis) methods to conduct my research.

## Research

1. Qualitative Research: how some users of [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com) think their practices on this platform impact the design industry and design education. Method: semi-structured interview & Fisher's test. Read our work [here](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pra2.604).

(Yes, I blurred th 30 participants' faces in this picture to protect privacy :] It only shows the other reseracher and me.)

2. Quantitative Research: what kinds of information got spreaded the most about Derek Chauvin's trial containing the hashtags of #BlackLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter. Method: Text annotation & machine learning. Read our work [here](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pra2.689).
