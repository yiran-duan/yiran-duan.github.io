# Home

Greetings! I'm a PhD student at the iSchool of Syracuse University. My research interest is in online opinion leaderships, espeically in the context of social movements and climate change debates. I'm lucky enough to be advised by [Dr.Jeff Hemsley](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeff-hemsley/). I use both qualitative (interview) and quantitative (machine learning, statistical analysis) methods to conduct my research. Through using Twitter's API 2.0, I also learned how to run Linux commands on virtual servers.

## Research

1. Qualitative Research: how some users of [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com) think their practices on this platform impact the design industry and design education. Method: semi-structured interview & Fisher's test. Read our work [here](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pra2.604). ![This is an image](https://yiran-duan.github.io/images/Interviewees.jpg)

2. Quantitative Research: what kinds of information got spreaded the most about Derek Chauvin's trial containing the hashtags of #BlackLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter. Method: Text annotation & machine learning. Read our work [here](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pra2.689).

## Teaching

## Life

When I'm not working on my research projects, I like to swim and play with my mini Australian Sheperd, Mia.
