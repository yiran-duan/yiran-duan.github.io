# Home

Greetings! I'm a PhD student at the Syracuse University iSchool. My research interest is in online opinion leaderships, espeically in the context of social movements and climate change debates. I'm lucky enough to be advised by [Dr.Jeff Hemsley](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeff-hemsley/). I use both qualitative (interview) and quantitative (machine learning, statistical analysis) methods to conduct my research. 

## Research

1. Qualitative Research: how some users of [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com) think their practices on this platform change the design industry and design education. Read our work [here](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pra2.604).

3. Quantitative Research: what kinds of information got spreaded the most about Derek Chauvin's trial using #BlackLivesMatter and #BlueLivesMatter. Read our work [here](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pra2.689).

## Teaching

A recitation section of IST 343 Data in Society for Fall 2022.

## Life

When I'm not working on my research projects, I like to swim and play with my mini Australian Sheperd, Mia.
