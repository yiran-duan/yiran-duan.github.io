# Home

**I am on the 2024 -2025 job market!** 

Greetings! I'm a PhD candidate at the [Syracuse University iSchool](https://ischool.syr.edu). My research explores information flows and the key actors involved, particularly across different social media platforms. I'm advised by [Dr.Jeff Hemsley](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeff-hemsley/). I use both qualitative (semi-structured interview) and quantitative (machine learning models, statistical analysis) methods to conduct my research.

## Research

1. Qualitative Research: how some users of [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com) think their practices on this platform impact the design industry and design education. Method: semi-structured interview & Fisher's test. Read our work that published in _Social Media + Society_ [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20563051241228601). ![This is an image](https://yiran-duan.github.io/images/dribbble.jpg)
(Yes, I blurred th 30 participants' faces in this picture to protect their privacy :] It only shows the other reseracher's and mine.)

2. Quantitative Research: what kinds of information got posted and spread during the Black History month of 2022. Methods: content analysis, machine learning models, and data visualization. Read our work that published in _Social Media + Society_ [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20563051241242799).![This is an image](https://yiran-duan.github.io/images/BLM-SMS-journal-pic.png)

3. Cross-platform Research: A study that explores 80 Instagram Reels, TikTok videos, YouTube Shorts, and YouTube regular videos and thier 69,000+ comments about climate change using content analysis, regresions, and social network analysis. I am going to give a presentation about this study at the conference of the Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T) at Calgary, Canada in October 2024.

## Teaching

A recitation section of IST 343 Data in Society for Fall 2022 and Spring 2023.

For Fall 2024, I am teaching IST 719 Data Visualization, a master's and PhD level class that teaches students how to do data analysis and visualization using R. Each week, I create presentations and guide students through over 100 lines of R code in real-time for them to follow along. 

## Life

When I'm not working on my research projects, I like to swim and play with my mini Australian Sheperd, Mia.
