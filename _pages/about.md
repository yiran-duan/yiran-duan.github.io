# Home

Greetings! I'm a PhD candidate at the [Syracuse University iSchool](https://ischool.syr.edu). My research explores information flows and the key actors involved, particularly across different social media platforms. I'm lucky to be advised by [Dr.Jeff Hemsley](https://ischool.syr.edu/jeff-hemsley/). I use both qualitative (interview) and quantitative (machine learning, statistical analysis) methods to conduct my research.

## Research

1. Qualitative Research: how some users of [Dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com) think their practices on this platform impact the design industry and design education. Method: semi-structured interview & Fisher's test. Read our work [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20563051241228601). ![This is an image](https://yiran-duan.github.io/images/dribbble.jpg)
(Yes, I blurred th 30 participants' faces in this picture to protect their privacy :] It only shows the other reseracher's and mine.)

2. Quantitative Research: what kinds of information got posted and spread during the Black History month of 2022. Methods: content analysis, machine learning models, and data visualization. Read our work [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20563051241242799).![This is an image](https://yiran-duan.github.io/images/retweets.svg)

## Teaching

A recitation section of IST 343 Data in Society for Fall 2022 and Spring 2023.
For Fall 2024, I am teaching IST 719 Data Visualization, a class doing data analysis and visualization using R.

## Life

When I'm not working on my research projects, I like to swim and play with my mini Australian Sheperd, Mia.
